## Overview

NaudeBourn is a **luxury jewelry platform** built with **Next.js** and integrated with **Shopify Storefront APIs**.  
In addition to Shopify’s default workflows, I built a dual-registration system where users are stored both in Shopify and in our own database for custom analytics.

## Features

- **Shopify Storefront API + GraphQL** queries for product fetching, cart, and checkout.  
- **Dual user registration** → Shopify + internal DB synchronization.  
- **Editor.js blog** for rich content management.  
- **SEO & Performance** → server-side rendering, structured metadata, GTM integration.  

## Technical Notes

- Used **GraphQL** to query products efficiently.  
- Optimized for SEO with `robots.txt`, structured metadata, and Google Tag Manager.
