## Overview

Civic Monitor Services is a **data scraping and monitoring system** that collects and processes large volumes of data in real-time.  
The challenge was to ensure efficiency under heavy workloads (~2GB Node.js runtime) while preventing database pool overload.

## Features

- **Parallel scraping pipelines** with controlled concurrency.  
- **DB performance optimizations** using pooling strategies and indexing.  
- **Mutex locks** to avoid race conditions and manage high-frequency inserts.  
- **Memory-safe Node.js runtime** capped under 2GB to prevent crashes.  

## Lessons Learned

- Managing **memory limits in Node.js** is critical at scale.  
- Mutex-based queueing significantly improved stability.  
- Optimized DB pool handling reduced connection timeouts by ~40%.
