Launching **NaudeBourn.com** was all about combining **brand aesthetics** with **technical scalability**.  

## Why Next.js + Shopify

Next.js enabled server-side rendering for SEO, while Shopify Storefront API gave us secure, production-grade e-commerce workflows.

## Blog with Editor.js

NaudeBourn features an integrated blog powered by **Editor.js**. This allows the marketing team to:  
- Write rich-text posts with media blocks.  
- Publish instantly without developer intervention.  
- Improve organic traffic via content marketing.

## Code Example

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
      {
        code:
`import { createStorefrontClient } from "@shopify/storefront-client";

const client = createStorefrontClient({
  storeDomain: "naude-bourn.myshopify.com",
  publicAccessToken: process.env.SHOPIFY_PUBLIC_TOKEN,
});

export async function getProducts() {
  return client.request(\`
    {
      products(first: 5) {
        edges { node { id title handle } }
      }
    }
  \`);
}`,
        language: "tsx",
        label: "Shopify API Integration"
      }
    ]}
/>

## Takeaways

- Shopify APIs provide secure, scalable commerce features.  
- Next.js ensures SEO + performance for storefronts.
